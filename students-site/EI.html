        <p><h2>How to write an essay introduction</h2>
          <li>A good introduction paragraph is an essential part of any academic essay. It sets up your argument and tells the reader what to expect.</li><br>
          <li>The main goals of an introduction are to:</li><br>
        <li>Catch your reader’s attention</li><br>
        <li>Give background on your topic.</li><br>
        <li>Present your thesis—the central point of your essay.</li><br>


<h2>Step 1: Hook your reader</h2>
<li>Your first sentence sets the tone for the whole essay, so spend some time on writing an effective hook.</li><br>

<li>Avoid long, dense sentences—start with something clear, concise and catchy that will spark your reader’s curiosity.</li><br>

<li>The hook should lead the reader into your essay, giving a sense of the topic you’re writing about and why it’s interesting. Avoid overly broad claims or plain statements of fact.</li><br>

<h3>Examples: Writing a good hook</h3>
<li>Take a look at these examples of weak hooks and learn how to improve them.</li><br>

<li>Braille was an extremely important invention.</li><br>
<li>The invention of Braille was a major turning point in the history of disability.</li><br>
<li>The first sentence is a dry fact; the second sentence is more interesting, making a bold claim about exactly why the topic is important.</li><br>

<li>The internet is defined as “a global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities.”</li><br>
<li>The spread of the internet has had a world-changing effect, not least on the world of education.</li><br>
<li>Avoid using a dictionary definition as your hook, especially if it’s an obvious term that everyone knows. The improved example here is still broad, but it gives us a much clearer sense of what the essay will be about.</li><br>

<li>Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein is a famous book from the nineteenth century.</li><br>
<li>Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein is often read as a crude cautionary tale about the dangers of scientific advancement.</li><br>
<li>Instead of just stating a fact that the reader already knows, the improved hook here tells us about the mainstream interpretation of the book, implying that this essay will offer a different interpretation.</li><br>

<li>The third principle is that everything in your essay should be relevant to the thesis. Ask yourself whether each piece of information advances your argument or provides necessary background. And make sure that the text clearly expresses each piece of information’s relevance.</li><br>

<li>The sections below present several organizational templates for essays: the chronological approach, the compare-and-contrast approach, and the problems-methods-solutions approach.</li><br>

      <h2>Step 2: Give background information</h2>
<li>Next, give your reader the context they need to understand your topic and argument. Depending on the subject of your essay, this might include:</li><br>

<li>Historical, geographical, or social context</li><br>
<li>An outline of the debate you’re addressing</li><br>
<li>A summary of relevant theories or research about the topic</li><br>


<li>Definitions of key terms</li><br>
<li>The information here should be broad but clearly focused and relevant to your argument.
Don’t give too much detail—you can mention points that you will return to later, but save your evidence and interpretation for the main body of the essay.</li><br>
<li>How much space you need for background depends on your topic and the scope of your essay. In our Braille example, we take a few sentences to introduce the topic and sketch the social context that the essay will address:</li><br>



    <li><h2>Step 3: Present your thesis statement</h2>
Now it’s time to narrow your focus and show exactly what you want to say about the topic. This is your thesis statement—a sentence or two that sums up your overall argument.</li><br>

<li>This is the most important part of your introduction. A  good thesis isn’t just a statement of fact, but a claim that requires evidence and explanation.</li><br>

<li>The goal is to clearly convey your own position in a debate or your central point about a topic.</li><br>

<h2>Step 4: Map your essay’s structure</h2>
<li>Particularly in longer essays, it’s helpful to end the introduction by signposting what will be covered in each part. Keep it concise and give your reader a clear sense of the direction your argument will take.</li><br>

<h2>Step 5: Check and revise</h2>
<li>As you research and write, your argument might change focus or direction as you learn more.</li><br>

<li>For this reason, it’s often a good idea to wait until later in the writing process before you write the introduction paragraph—it can even be the very last thing you write.</li><br>

<li>When you’ve finished writing the essay body and conclusion, you should return to the introduction and check that it matches the content of the essay.</li><br>

<li>It’s especially important to make sure your thesis statement accurately represents what you do in the essay. If your argument has gone in a different direction than planned, tweak your thesis statement to match what you actually say.</li><br>

<li>You can use the checklist below to make sure your introduction does everything it’s supposed to.</li></p>
