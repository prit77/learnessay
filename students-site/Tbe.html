        <p><h2>Writing the body of an essay</h2>
          <li>The body is the longest part of an essay. This is where you lead the reader through your ideas, elaborating arguments and evidence for your thesis. The body is always divided into paragraphs.</li><br>
          <li>You can work through the body in three main stages:</li><br>
        <li>Create an outline of what you want to say and in what order.</li><br>
        <li>Write a first draft to get your main ideas down on paper.</li><br>
        <li>Write a second draft to clarify your arguments and make sure everything fits together.</li><br>
        <li>This article gives you some practical tips for how to approach each stage.</li><br>


<h2>Start with an outline</h2>
<li>Before you start, make a rough outline that sketches out the main points you want to make and the order you’ll make them in. This can help you remember how each part of the essay should relate to the other parts.</li><br>

<li>However, remember that the outline isn’t set in stone – don’t be afraid to change the organization if necessary. Work on an essay’s structure begins before you start writing, but it continues as you write, and goes on even after you’ve finished writing the first draft.</li><br>

<li>While you’re writing a certain section, if you come up with an idea for something elsewhere in the essay, take a few moments to add to your outline or make notes on your organizational plans.</li><br>

<h2>Write the first draft</h2>
<li>Your goals in the first draft are to turn your rough ideas into workable arguments, add detail to those arguments, and get a sense of what the final product will actually look like.</li><br>

<h3>Write strong body paragraphs</h3>
<li>Many writers do not begin writing at the introduction, or even the early body paragraphs. Start writing your essay where it seems most natural for you to do so.</li><br>

<h3>Tackle one idea at a time</h3>
<li>Each paragraph should aim to focus on one central idea, giving evidence, explanation, and arguments that relate to that idea.</li><br>

<li>At the start of each paragraph, write a topic sentence that expresses the main point. Then elaborate and expand on the topic sentence in the rest of the paragraph</li><br>

<li>When you’ve said everything you have to say about the idea, move onto a new paragraph.</li><br>

<h3>Keep your argument flexible</h3>
<li>You may realize as you write that some of your ideas don’t work as well as you thought they would. Don’t give up on them too easily, but be prepared to change or abandon sections if you realize they don’t make sense.</li><br>

<li>You’ll probably also come up with new ideas that you’d not yet thought of when writing the outline. Note these ideas down and incorporate them into the essay if there’s a logical place for them.</li><br>

<li>If you’re stuck on one section, move on to another part of the essay and come back to it later.</li><br>
<li></li><br>

      <h2>Draw clear connections between your ideas</h2>
<li>Finally, you should assess how your ideas fit together both within and between paragraphs. The connections might be clear to you, but you need to make sure they’ll also be clear to your reader.</li><br>

<li>Within each paragraph, does each sentence follow logically from the one before it? If not, you might need to add new sentences to make the connections clear. Try using transition words to clarify what you want to say.</li><br>

<li>Between one paragraph and the next, is it clear how your points relate to one another? If you are moving onto an entirely new topic, consider starting the paragraph with a transition sentence that moves from the previous topic and shows how it relates to the new one.</li><br>

    <li><h2>Check the organization</h2>
When you’re happy with all the main parts of your essay, take another look at the overall shape of it. You want to make sure that everything proceeds in a logical order without unnecessary repetition.</li><br>

<li>Try listing only the topic sentence of each paragraph and reading them in order. Are any of the topic sentences too similar? Each paragraph should discuss something different; if two paragraphs are about the same topic, they must approach it in different ways, and these differences should be made clear in the topic sentences.</li><br>

<li>Does the order of information make sense? Looking at only topic sentences lets you see at a glance the route your paper takes from start to finish, allowing you to spot organizational errors more easily.</li><br></p>
