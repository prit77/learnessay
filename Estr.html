        <p><h2>How to structure an essay: Templates and tips</h2>
          <li>The basic structure of an essay always consists of an introduction, a body, and a conclusion. But for many students, the most difficult part of structuring an essay is deciding how to organize information within the body.</li><br>
          <li>This article provides useful templates and tips to help you outline your essay, make decisions about your structure, and organize your text logically.</li><br>
        <li><h2>The basics of essay structure</h2>
There are two main things to keep in mind when working on your essay structure: making sure to include the right information in each part, and deciding how you’ll organize the information within the body.</li><br><br><br>


<h2>Order of information</h2>
<li>You’ll also have to consider how to present information within the body. There are a few general principles that can guide you here.</li><br>

<li>The first is that your argument should move from the simplest claim to the most complex. The body of a good argumentative essay often begins with simple and widely accepted claims, and then moves towards more complex and contentious ones.</li><br>

<li>For example, you might begin by describing a generally accepted philosophical concept, and then apply it to a new topic. The grounding in the general concept will allow the reader to understand your unique application of it.</li><br>

<li>The second principle is that background information should appear towards the beginning of your essay. General background is presented in the introduction. If you have additional background to present, this information will usually come at the start of the body.</li><br>

<li>The third principle is that everything in your essay should be relevant to the thesis. Ask yourself whether each piece of information advances your argument or provides necessary background. And make sure that the text clearly expresses each piece of information’s relevance.</li><br>

<li>The sections below present several organizational templates for essays: the chronological approach, the compare-and-contrast approach, and the problems-methods-solutions approach.</li><br>

      <h2>Chronological structure</h2>
<li>The chronological approach (sometimes called the cause-and-effect approach) is probably the simplest way to structure an essay. It just means discussing events in the order in which they occurred, discussing how they are related (i.e. the cause and effect involved) as you go.</li><br>

<li>A chronological approach can be useful when your essay is about a series of events. Don’t rule out other approaches, though—even when the chronological approach is the obvious one, you might be able to bring out more with a different structure.</li><br>

<li>Explore the tabs below to see a general template and a specific example outline from an essay on the invention of the printing press.</li><br>
    <li><h2>Problems-methods-solutions structure</h2>
An essay that concerns a specific problem (practical or theoretical) may be structured according to the problems-methods-solutions approach.</li><br>

<li>This is just what it sounds like: You define the problem, characterize a method or theory that may solve it, and finally analyze the problem, using this method or theory to arrive at a solution. If the problem is theoretical, the solution might be the analysis you present in the essay itself; otherwise, you might just present a proposed solution.</li><br>

<li>The tabs below show a template for this structure and an example outline for an essay about the problem of fake news.</li><br></p>
