            <h2>1.
Read your assignment carefully.</h2>
            <p>
 The style, structure, and focus of your essay will vary depending on the type of essay you are writing. If you've been assigned to write an essay for a class, review the assignment carefully and look for information about the nature of the essay. A few common types of essays include:[1]<br><br>
The compare/contrast essay, which focuses on analyzing the similarities and differences between 2 things, such as ideas, people, events, places, or works of art.
<br><br>The narrative essay, which tells a story.
<br><br>The argumentative essay, in which the writer uses evidence and examples to convince the reader of their point of view.
<br><br>The critical or analytical essay, which examines something (such as a text or work of art) in detail. This type of essay may attempt to answer specific questions about the subject or focus more generally on its meaning.
<br><br>The informative essay, that educates the reader about a topic.
</p>

<h2>2.
Check for formatting and style requirements.</h2>
 <p>
 If you're writing an essay for a class or a publication, there may be specific formatting and style requirements you need to follow. Read your assignment carefully to make sure you understand requirements such as:
<br><br>How long your essay should be
<br><br>Which citation style to use
<br><br>Formatting requirements, such as margin size, line spacing, and font size and type</p>

        <h2>3.
Narrow down your topic so your essay has a clear focus. </h2>
        <p>
Depending on your assignment, you may already have a specific topic you are supposed to write about, or you may simply be asked to write about a general theme or subject. If the assignment doesn't specify your topic, take some time to brainstorm. Try to pick a subject that's specific, interesting to you, and that you think will give you plenty of material to work with.[2]
<br><br>If you're doing a research-based essay, you might find some inspiration from reading through some of the major sources on the subject.
<br><br>For a critical essay, you might choose to focus on a particular theme in the work you're discussing, or analyze the meaning of a specific passage</p>

<li><span><img src="images/4.jpg"></span></li>
      <h2>4.
Ask for clarification if you don't understand the assignment.</h2>
      <p>
 If you're not sure what you're supposed to be writing about or how to structure your essay, don't hesitate to ask! Your instructor can help clarify anything you don't understand, and they may even be able to provide examples of the type of work they're looking for.[3]
<br><br>If you're having trouble narrowing down your topic, your instructor might be able to provide guidance or inspiration.</p>
